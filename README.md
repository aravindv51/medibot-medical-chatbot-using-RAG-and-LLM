# medibot-medical-chatbot-using-RAG-and-LLM | SELF PROJECT
* Developed a medical chatbot using Streamlit, LangChain, FAISS, and LLaMA-4 to provide doctors and students quick, context-aware answers from clinical PDFs.
* Engineered a pipeline to chunk/embed medical PDFs via HuggingFace transformers for scalable semantic search.
* Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with FAISS and custom prompt engineering to enhance LLM reliability, reduce hallucinations, and ensure real-time, medically consistent responses.
